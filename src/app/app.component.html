        <li>[x] Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>

          the game

        <li>
          [x] When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number)
          should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
        </li>
        <li>[x] The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>

          [x] When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted
          (clearInterval(ref))

        <li>
          [x] A new Odd component should get created for every odd number
          emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even
          numbers)
        </li>
        <li>
          [x] Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
        </li>
        <li>
          [x] Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text
          differently in both components
